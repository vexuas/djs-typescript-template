# djs-typescript-template

A complete and opinionated template to create Discord apps using discordjs and typescript

This project came about from me realising I take a ridiculous amount of time trying to set up a new Discord app from scratch. Not only from initialising the project but also adding the relevant foundations and features that I primarily use. Since most of my coding projects revolve around Discord and me being a sucker for productivity, I decided to create a boilerplate modelled after how I normally develop them.

I'm not sure exactly how much time would be saved but it did feel pretty significant when I used this on [Nino, a random anime image app](https://github.com/vexuas/nino), which took roughly just under a week from initialising the project to having a running production instance. Pretty good numbers if you ask me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
