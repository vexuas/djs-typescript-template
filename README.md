# djs-typescript-template

A complete and opinionated template to create Discord apps using discordjs and typescript

This project came about from me realising I take a ridiculous amount of time trying to set up a new Discord app from scratch. Not only from initialising the project but also adding the relevant structures and dev foundations that I primiarily use.
